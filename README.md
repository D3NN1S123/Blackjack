# Blackjack

Simple Blackjack Game made using JavaScript, HTML/CSS. Rules of the game are the same as the original blackjack. The player can either play against another player (beside them), or can choose to play against a robot dealer. If playing against a dealer, the player can choose to hit or stand as they please. If when they stand, their final value is closer to 21 than the dealer's final value, they win. If not, they lose.
