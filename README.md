# Blackjack

Simple Blackjack Game made using JavaScript, HTML/CSS. Rules of the game are the same as the original blackjack. 

Rules:
The player starts by making a bet. Bet amounts are based on how much money you have in your wallet when you start. 

Player starts with 2 cards, face up. Dealer starts with 2 cards; one face up, one face down. The player can choose to hit (get another card), or stand (stop the round). If when you hit, your hand value becomes above 21, you bust, and lose. If you're comfortable with your hand, you stand. When you stand, the dealer flips up its face down card. When this card is flipped up, and the dealer's hand is still below 17, the dealer flips up one more card. If the dealer gets above 21, it busts, and you win. If the dealer gets below 21, but higher than the value of your hand, you lose. If the dealer gets 21 when you don't have 21, you lose. If the dealer has the same hand value as you, you get your bet returned to you. 

Currently working on visual design of the website. Will then work on some backend stuff, account creation, wallet balance memory, etc.
